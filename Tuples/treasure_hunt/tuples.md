# Instructions

Azara and Rui are teammates competing in a pirate-themed treasure hunt. One has a list of treasures with map coordinates, the other a list of location names with map coordinates. They've also been given blank maps with a starting place marked YOU ARE HERE.

But things are a bit disorganized: Azara's coordinates appear to be formatted and sorted differently from Rui's, and they have to keep looking from one list to the other to figure out which treasures go with which locations. Being budding pythonistas, they have come to you for help in writing a small program (a set of functions, really) to better organize their hunt information.

## Task 1

### Extract coordinates

Implement the **get_coordinate()** function that takes a **(treasure, coordinate)** pair from Azara's list and returns only the extracted map coordinate.

    >>> get_coordinate(('Scrimshawed Whale Tooth', '2A'))
    2A

## Task 2

### Format coordinates

Implement the **convert_coordinate()** function that takes a coordinate in the format "2A" and returns a tuple in the format **("2", "A")**.

    >>> convert_coordinate("2A")
    ("2", "A")

## Task 3

### Match coordinates

Implement the **compare_records()** function that takes a **(treasure, coordinate)** pair and a **(location, coordinate, quadrant)** record and compares coordinates from each. Return **True** if the coordinates "match", and return **False** if they do not. Re-format coordinates as needed for accurate comparison.

    > > > compare_records(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'), ('Seaside Cottages', ('1', 'C'), 'blue'))
    > > > False

    > > > compare_records(('Model Ship in Large Bottle', '8A'), ('Harbor Managers Office', ('8', 'A'), 'purple'))
    > > > True

## Task 4

### Combine matched records

Implement the **create_record()** function that takes a **(treasure, coordinate)** pair from Azara's list and a **(location, coordinate, quadrant)** record from Rui's list and returns **(treasure, coordinate, location, coordinate, quadrant)** if the coordinates match. If the coordinates do not match, return the string "not a match". Re-format the coordinate as needed for accurate comparison.

    >>> create_record(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'), ('Abandoned Lighthouse', ('4', 'B'), 'Blue'))
    ('Brass Spyglass', '4B', 'Abandoned Lighthouse', ('4', 'B'), 'Blue')

    >>> create_record(('Brass Spyglass', '4B'), ('Seaside Cottages', ('1', 'C'), 'blue'))
    "not a match"
