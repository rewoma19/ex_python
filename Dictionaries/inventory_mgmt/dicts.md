# Instructions

In this exercise, you will be managing an inventory system.

The inventory should be organized by the item name and it should keep track of the number of items available.

You will have to handle adding items to an inventory. Each time an item appears in a given list, the item's quantity should be increased by **1** in the inventory. You will also have to handle deleting items from an inventory by decreasing quantities by **1** when requested.

Finally, you will need to implement a function that will return all the key-value pairs in a given inventory as a **list** of **tuples**.

## Task 1

### Create an inventory based on a list

Implement the **create_inventory(<input list>)** function that creates an "inventory" from an input list of items. It should return a **dict** containing each item name paired with their respective quantity.

    >>> create_inventory(["coal", "wood", "wood", "diamond", "diamond", "diamond"])
    {"coal":1, "wood":2, "diamond":3}

## Task 2

### Add items from a list to an existing dictionary

Implement the **add_items(<inventory dict>, <item list>)** function that adds a list of items to the passed-in inventory:

    >>> add_items({"coal":1}, ["wood", "iron", "coal", "wood"])
    {"coal":2, "wood":2, "iron":1}

## Task 3

### Decrement items from the inventory

Implement the **decrement_items(<inventory dict>, <items list>)** function that takes a **list** of items. Your function should remove **1** from an item count for each time that item appears on the **list**:

    >>> decrement_items({"coal":3, "diamond":1, "iron":5}, ["diamond", "coal", "iron", "iron"])
    {"coal":2, "diamond":0, "iron":3}

Item counts in the inventory should not be allowed to fall below 0. If the number of times an item appears on the input **list** exceeds the count available, the quantity listed for that item should remain at 0. Additional requests for removing counts should be ignored once the count falls to zero.

    >>> decrement_items({"coal":2, "wood":1, "diamond":2}, ["coal", "coal", "wood", "wood", "diamond"])
    {"coal":0, "wood":0, "diamond":1}

## Task 4

### Remove an entry entirely from the inventory

Implement the **remove_item(<inventory dict>, <item>)** function that removes an item and its count entirely from an inventory:

    >>> remove_item({"coal":2, "wood":1, "diamond":2}, "coal")
    {"wood":1, "diamond":2}

If the item is not found in the inventory, the function should return the original inventory unchanged.

    >>> remove_item({"coal":2, "wood":1, "diamond":2}, "gold")
    {"coal":2, "wood":1, "diamond":2}

## Task 5

### Return the entire content of the inventory

Implement the **list_inventory(<inventory dict>)** function that takes an inventory and returns a list of **(item, quantity)** tuples. The list should only include the available items (with a quantity greater than zero):

    >>> list_inventory({"coal":7, "wood":11, "diamond":2, "iron":7, "silver":0})
    [('coal', 7), ('diamond', 2), ('iron', 7), ('wood', 11)]
